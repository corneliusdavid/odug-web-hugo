PRESENTATION

We'll be going over how to create XML documents in Delphi using the XML Binding Wizard to create the document from either an XSD or XML file. We'll use a web broker based REST server to serve up the document and then read it in using a Delphi client. As we do that we'll define what a REST server is and why it's replacing SOAP servers.

We will also look at using the web services wizard to read in WSDL from a SOAP based web service. This is nice because we can see how it hides all the complexities of XML from us. Delphi Pro will be used, but we can discuss what DataSnap is capable of doing as well.  We'll also discuss JSON because in many places it is starting to replace XML where the complexities of XML are not necessary.

If there is time we will create JSON from the web broker server and read it in using a Delphi client. The push towards simplification of the data we transfer on the web right now is strong so we need to understand each of these technologies as well as how they have influenced each other.
