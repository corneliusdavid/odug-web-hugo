We don't usually meet during the summer months of July or August, and with the future of ODUG still uncertain, this will be the last meeting for a while.  We may pick back up in the fall depending on who's in the area and the interest level.

In the absence of a specific topic, we may continue or follow-up on last month's discussion about more frequent upgrades to Delphi and the uproar over the price. Or we may talk about branching and merging source files with subversion. But most likely, we'll just chat as good friends that enjoy software development.
