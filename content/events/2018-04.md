<h3>TOPIC</h3>

<p>
This is a continuation of the discussion on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)">SOLID</a> programming principles we started last month. We'll finish up our coverage of <strong>Single Responsibility</strong> and <strong>Open/Closed</strong> principles, then continue on with aspects of the other three:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Liskov Substitution</strong> - objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program,</li>
<li><strong>Interface Segregation</strong> - many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface, and</li>
<li><strong>Dependency Inversion</strong> - one should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>PRESENTER</h3>

<p>
This will be a group discussion led by Ron Grove.
