## TOPIC ##

This is a continuation of the discussion on [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) programming principles we started last month. We'll finish up our coverage of **Single Responsibility** and **Open/Closed** principles, then continue on with aspects of the other three:

- **Liskov Substitution** - objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program,
- **Interface Segregation** - many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface, and
- **Dependency Inversion** - one should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.

## PRESENTER ##

This will be group discussion led by **Ron Grove**, based in large part on his deep knowledge of the subject having read [the book](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445) the SOLID principles were based on before the acronym was coined.
