The topics that will be covered during this presentation include:

**Advantage TDataSet Descendant VCL for .NET**, the BDP.NET provider and the native Advantage NET Data Provider.  Advantage Database is one of the few database solutions that provide complete support for Delphi 2005.

**Advantage Version 8.0** is currently in Beta. The new version includes replication, on-line backup, scripting, transaction savepoints, and a newly re-designed Advantage Data Architect.

Remember, the local server (peer-to-peer) is FREE and there is a low-priced, easy-to-use <i>web server license</i>. In addition, we'll talk about our integration with iAnyWhere, a Sybase subsidiary.
