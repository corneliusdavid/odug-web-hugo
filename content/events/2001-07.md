## TOPIC ##

Ed ran into quite a problem while trying to attach Word documents to an Interbase database&#151;nothing seemed to work. He'll show us the method that finally did the trick.

He'll also show the general outline of his system and the objects used. This is very extensive with about 50 forms and 50 tables. All of these are tied together with the users always having the same look and feel no matter where they are in the system.

## PRESENTER ##

Ed is an independent developer who writes systems for mental health professionals using Delphi and InterBase 6.0. He also works for Providence Health Plans as a systems developer doing MS SQL and Delphi development.
