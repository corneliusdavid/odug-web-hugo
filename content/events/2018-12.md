Since our regularly scheduled meeting for November fell on the day before Thanksgiving and NO ONE would be there, we decided to move the meeting date forward a couple of weeks. We don't normally meet in December, but we'll make an exception because it's early enough in the month that it shouldn't conflict with any holiday/family plans.

We won't have a specific presenter but could start off the discussion with how the year went for everyone, touch on some of the interesting news highlights in the tech industry, and go from there.
