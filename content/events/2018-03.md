<h3>TOPIC</h3>

<a href="http://blog.synopse.info/post/2015/05/03/SOLID-Design-Principles"><img src="https://cre8ivethought.s3.amazonaws.com/images/solid/SOLID-small.jpg" hspace="5" align="right"></a>It's time to get into some coding practices.  This is the first in a series exploring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)">SOLID</a> principles of software development.  This month, we'll concentrate on the Single Responsibility Principle. As time allows we'll start looking at the "O" which stands for the Open/Closed principle. Many of us have probably used these principles even though we may not have had fancy terms like this in mind at the time. Hopefully we can help one another think about how we can make use of common sense principles like these in our own work.
