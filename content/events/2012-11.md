TOPIC

Yes, this is a word play on "Tales from the Crypt" and will be a fun meeting where we share horror stories in coding.  Bring your experiences of programming gone awry, the unbelievable code you've been handed, the strangest bugs, or the most unbelievable deadlines imposed on you and the terrible consequences that resulted.  We will commiserate together and laugh at what the sales people in the organizations we work for have tried to do to us or ponder about what the previous programmer must've been smoking when s/he wrote the code we're trying to debug.

We'll have a laptop with Delphi 2010 and a USB drive if you want to bring screen shots or code snippets to display. Otherwise, it will just be a fun time of sharing.
