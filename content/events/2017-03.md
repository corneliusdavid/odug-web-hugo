## TOPIC ##

Have you ever heard the phrase, [March is for Makers](http://marchisformakers.com)? With the rise of inexpensive and easy-to-use micro computers, people are enjoying the hobby of making all kinds of gadgets themselves. [Arduino](http://www.arduino.org) and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) are two of the most popular names in the maker space.

So what does this have to do with Delphi? Nothing necessarily. However, some of our members have shown how to connect and control small devices with a Delphi program. I'm not sure you'll see any of that this month, but we will be digressing from our regular topic and having a little fun with hardware. One of the devices that will be shared has been described as "Music of the Grids." 

Sounds intriguing? You'll have to be there to see what we have!
