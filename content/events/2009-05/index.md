## TOPIC ##

There is a saying that any technology that is sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic!

There are a lot of new features and language enhancements in the last three versions of Delphi that may seem like magic to those who do not know about them.  And there are some features that have been in Delphi for a long time that some don't realize are there.

On May 18, 2009, the mysteries of the unknown and the secrets of the masters will be shown in real applications.  These tips will enhance productivity, prevent errors, and aid in coding.  (Caution: There may be a temporary drop in air pressure as everyone gasps in amazement!)

Here is a preview of some of the topics to be covered:

- Hot Keys
- Live Templates
- Component Templates
- Unit Testing
- Theme Support
- Handy Functions
- Component Injection
- New Components
- *And more!*

We will move fast, but there will be references to several CodeRage sessions made by well-known speakers over the last few years.  These sessions have been downloaded and will be available to copy to your memory stick (AKA jump drive) after the meeting.
