## TOPIC ##

Our main topic for the first meeting of 2022 will be shared by **Homer Jones**:

If you've ever right clicked a file in Windows Explorer and selected Properties, you may have noticed the Detail tab. Those details list the **file's metadata**. Depending on the type of file, that metadata can have interesting information about the data in the file (the definition of metadata). Homer will show how to extract that metadata without displaying the actual contents of the file. For example, a PDF document might contain the name of the author, or the company, or other key words. A photograph might contain the same information plus the brand and model of the camera and lens that took the photo. Metadata schema has changed over the years; Homer will show three ways to extract.
