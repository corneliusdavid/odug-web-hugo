<h3>TOPIC</h3>
<p>
We have something a little different this month. Gene Juhos will bring a couple of <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> projects he's been working on:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Pill dispenser for the Age(d)s</li>
<li>Socket head screw safety wire hole deburring machine.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We'll probably have some left-over time, so if you have any hardware projects to add to the discussion, feel free to bring them and share with everyone.
