We have something a little different this month. **Gene Juhos** will bring a couple of [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) projects he's been working on:

- Pill dispenser for the Age(d)s
- Socket head screw safety wire hole deburring machine.

We'll probably have some left-over time, so if you have any hardware projects to add to the discussion, feel free to bring them and share with everyone.

## PRESENTER ##

**Gene Juhos** has been working with Delphi since version 3. Before that he used the Pascal language on the Apple Lisa. He started his programming career writing code for an IBM 3741. Heâ€™s written useful code in COBOL, FORTRAN, C, C++, Assembler, and CADOL. Currently, his business, [Sysmatics](https://sysmatics.com), converts proprietary character based business applications to Delphi for several customers.
