Everyone has their favorite Delphi IDE plug-in, their favorite Notepad replacement, their favorite tricks for saving time.  We'll share these tips with each other tonight.

Make a list of your favorite ways to shorten your development time and bring them to share with the others.  If you have a knowledgebase of tricks, or a favorite programming construct, or even if you have a question for the group on how to do something better or faster, let's hear about it!

Everyone should be able to take home some ideas to improve their programming day!
