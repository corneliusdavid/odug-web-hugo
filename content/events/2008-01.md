## TOPIC ##


This month we'll explore some custom-written non-visual components that have been useful in several projects, encapsulating common functionality for ease of use and consistency.  This isn't a new topic, but is a great starting point to discuss unit testing.  Unit testing is not a new topic either, but one that more people should look at.

Studying these two topics together could branch in various directions, depending on questions and preferences from the audience.  We may even continue the discussion at our March meeting if need be or dive into more detailed areas of study.

I invite you to join us and bring your experiences of incorporating libraries and testing methodologies into your programming projects.
