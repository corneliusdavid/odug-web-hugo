<h3>TOPIC</h3>

<p>
This month we will show how, by adding a simple library to your old Delphi code, your Windows VCL application can run through a web browser on any device that supports HTML5. No need to use WebBroker or convert it to IntraWeb or Firemonkey, just simply open up your project, add a unit, recompile, and it now is able to paint on an HTML5 Canvas--provided the <a href="https://www.cybelesoft.com/thinfinity/virtualui/">Thinfinity VirtualUI</a> server is running.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, there are hooks to enable your application to interact with the web browser to which it is painting and enhance the user experience in expected "web" ways.
</p>

<p>
Come tonight and see how easy it is to take your application to the web!
</p>
