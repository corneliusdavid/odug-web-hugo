<h3>TOPIC</h3>

<p>
There's a pretty cool framework in .NET from DevExpress called <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/Application_Framework/">XAF</a>. We'll start out with some tech talk and see if there's anything Delphi related that we'd like to discuss. Then demonstrate some of the cool features XAF has to offer and why some of the things it's trying to do may become the norm over time in software development.
