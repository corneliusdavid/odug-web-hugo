[A year ago](/events/2023-01/), David mentioned a growing interest in building websites using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and studying its underlying Go programming language; we took a look at both briefly. After building three small sites from scratch, he converted an existing site built with Drupal; this ODUG website was the result of that effort. A theme was found and modified to make the meeting notices look like Pascal procedures.

It took a bunch of work and that experience will be shared, along with some of the details of how the site is put together, at the January meeting.

The Hugo "source" for the site, in Markdown pages and TOML config files, is all up on [GitHub](https://github.com/corneliusdavid/odug-web-hugo). This means that if you want to contribute, you can clone the site and create pull events. You can also look at the changes to the [theme](https://github.com/corneliusdavid/hugo-pascalinia) from its original and see how it was modified.
