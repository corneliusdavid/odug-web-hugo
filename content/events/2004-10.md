The votes are in--a new template for the web site has been chosen! The new HTML pages will have WebBroker tags throughout and the resulting pages generated by OdugWebBuilder, a Delphi/Kylix application. The Pascal code contains a reusable base class that can be extended for a variety of databases. In fact, it was first designed to work with DBISAM a couple of years ago, but tonight's presentation will describe the Firebird version. 

We'll also look at OdugWebMgr, a nearly-complete program which will be used to manage the data for the ODUG web site. You'll see how easy it is to create a cross-platform, CLX application with dbExpress.
