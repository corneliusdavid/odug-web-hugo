## TOPIC ##

How do users perceive the difference between a rich application and an online resource?  What processes should developers use to capture these differences? How are projects affected by the results of these processes? Leo Frishberg, a software developer, usability consultant, and user-centered designer, will talk about user-centered design in the context of the Web vs. the desktop.  Using examples from projects in both environments, Leo will point out the similarities and differences in users' expectations, approaches, and behaviors when faced with an application or online resource.
