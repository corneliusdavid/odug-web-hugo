Because of dwindling attendance, it's been difficult to convince anyone to present to the group.  Instead of a formal presentation, David Cornelius will be available with Delphi 5, 6, and 2005 for creating sample applications as the group's discussion leads.

Also, he will be willing to show the code behind a new project he's been working on lately, Project Timer.  This small database application uses dbExpress and dbGo to connect to Microsoft SQL Server and helps him keep track of time spent on projects for various clients.  There are already many such programs, but none that are free, connect to a database across the internet, provide a variety of reports (not yet implemented), export to XML and QuickBooks (not yet implemented), and are open source!  He has quite a ways to go yet (including removing a proprietary grid component), but is already using it every day.
