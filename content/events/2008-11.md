The end of the year is fast approaching.  Since we only meet every other month, this is the last meeting this year.  I had asked CodeGear to come out and show us Delphi 2009 and talk about new developments, but that doesn't seem to be an option for us right now.

So for our November meeting tomorrow night, I would like to open up the floor to discussion on Delphi news and developments and invite you to share your opinions on where the programming tools are heading. Has anyone upgraded to Delphi 2009?  Is anyone doing Unicode development?  Is anyone doing Delphi.Net development?  Have you heard what its replacement is?

If instead we want to get into some code, I'll have my laptop and a projector there with Delphi 2006 for Win32.  I also have Visual Studio 2005 with RemObject's Chrome Pascal compiler plug-in, the initial version of Oxygene.

In any case, we'll have a great time.  Remember, we're now meeting in the (east) classroom of Medical Office Building, still at Legacy Emanuel Hospital.  Hope to see you there!
