Due to the high interest in Content Management Systems (CMSs) and PHP scripting, we'll spend this month's meeting discussing them. There won't be a formal presentation, but there will be a laptop with a working copy of WAMP (Windows/Apache/MySQL/PHP) and at least Drupal and Joomla! loaded.

To get you started on a good discussion, here are some web sites for
reference you can browse beforehand:

- Read independent evaluations: [CMS Watch](http://www.cmswatch.com)
- Explore and test: [Open Source CMS](http://www.opensourcecms.com)
- Compare and discuss: [CMS Matrix](http://cmsmatrix.org)

PRESENTER:

He is the coordinator of the Oregon Delphi User Group, works for [Retail Dimensions](http://retaildimensions.com), and runs a contract software development business ([CorneliusConcepts.com](http://corneliusconcepts.com)) and a web hosting company ([Sohlius](http://sohlius.com)) with a friend in his "spare" time.
