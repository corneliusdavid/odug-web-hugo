## TOPIC ##

One of our members has been diving into the **FireMonkey** framework and has written his **first Android app**. This is not a formal presentation--he will simply share some of the journey he undertook as he used FireMonkey and REST services in both a Windows and an Android app to control home automation devices with Delphi XE7. 

## PRESENTER ##

**Mike Shkolnik** is a Project Manager in the Portland area and while he's been "using Delphi since it was Turbo Pascal on a CP/M card in an Apple II," he is completely self-taught and does not consider himself an expert. (In other words, he's like many of us!)
