Have you ever wanted to embed an InterBase installation along with user, database and table creation within the installation of your Delphi application? Obstacles, caveats and possible solutions will be explored. Although Wise Installation Systems will be utilized for part of the solution, the concepts should be able to be carried over to any installation tool.

PRESENTER:

Jeff Sohler has considerable experience with Oracle and has worked with Delphi off and on since it's inception. Presently, he is employed with Interactive Northwest, headquartered in Tualatin.They develop Telephony, IVR (Interactive Voice Response) and Speech Recognition solutions on both Windows and Unix platforms (hopefully Linux soon!). Jeff has experience in these environments, but his present title is "Windows Development Project Manager".  He's not a full-time "administrator"... because of the company's small size, he spends lots of time "down in the trenches" slinging code, writing SQL and designing solutions with the rest of the team.
