## TOPIC ##

This month we will show how, by adding a simple library to your old Delphi code, your Windows VCL application can run through a web browser on any device that supports HTML5. No need to use WebBroker or convert it to IntraWeb or Firemonkey, just simply open up your project, add a unit, recompile, and it now is able to paint on an HTML5 Canvas--provided the [Thinfinity VirtualUI](https://www.cybelesoft.com/thinfinity/virtualui) server is running.

Additionally, there are hooks to enable your application to interact with the web browser to which it is painting and enhance the user experience in expected "web" ways.

Come tonight and see how easy it is to take your application to the web!
