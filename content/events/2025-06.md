This month's focus will be on using AI as a professional developer and what we might want to do with a newly acquired domain, pnwdelphi.org.

[Embarcadero's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@EmbarcaderoTech) is hosting an AI-focused series of webinars the week of June 16-20, called AI CodeCamp. These sessions cover topics such as embedding AI in your programs, training models to recognize images, enabling your app to allow AI to control it, and how to use AI in your every day life.

Let's ride on the back of that theme by discussing how we use AI in various capacities and how we see AI changing the tech industry in general.

Additionally, the domain, [pnwdelphi.org](https://pnwdelphi.org/), has just been acquired and the slate is wide open on what to do with it. It'd be great to show Delphi's prevalence in the Pacific Northwest (as the name implies) but it needs links and pictures and other content to fill it out. Check out the current "place-holder" site and follow the links to test sites I set up with a couple of AI website generators. Perhaps you'll have an idea to share with the group!
