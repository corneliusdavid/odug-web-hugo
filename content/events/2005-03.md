## TOPIC ##

Lights! Sounds! Monsters!

You know you've always wanted to be writing games instead of... whatever you're getting paid for at the moment.  Tonight we'll look at doing graphics in Delphi. The talk will focus on using DirectX for Windows to create 3D graphics and the efforts of the JEDI team to make DirectX more accesable to Delphi programmers. We'll also touch on input (keyboard, joystick, etc.) and perhaps sound.

As for writing Doom 7...  well, you have to start somewhere!

**Chris Newcombe** works as a computer consultant, and has been using Borland's Pascal products since Turbo Pascal 3. He currently uses Delphi 7 and 2005.  Alas, most of his projects are less fun to work on than games.
