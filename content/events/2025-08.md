Jonathan Eaton will demonstrate and code review a tool he developed in Delphi for speeding up the process of updating a client's business system to accommodate changes to IRS forms.

This tool uses two different types of canvases (not all canvases are created equal!) to create a visual interface for placing data into the appropriate lines and boxes in IRS forms, and then records the positions in a file that is loaded by the client's software in order to produce the completed forms.


## PRESENTER ##
