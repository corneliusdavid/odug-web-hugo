## TOPIC ##

Dexter is the next version of Delphi, Delphi 2006.  It is a 64-bit compiler supporting the latest Win32 and .NET environments.  Come learn about the next version of Pascal/C++/C# compilers from Borland and see ECO III  in action (it's child's play!).

There will be **give-aways**, including a copy of Delphi 2006.  You won't want to miss it!

## PRESENTER ##

**Anders Ohlsson** from Borland Software Corporation ([borland.com](http://borland.com))
