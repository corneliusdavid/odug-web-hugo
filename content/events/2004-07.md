This month's presentation will be an interactive discussion on Good Coding Practices. David Cornelius will launch the discussion covering the following topics:

- Indentation and spacing
- Good naming conventions
- Writing robust code
- And why everyone needs version control!

Some example code, both personally written and commercially sold, will be shown--and you'll get to help decide how well it was written! A free tool for quickly formatting poorly-written code will be shown and a few IDE tricks for speeding up development while preserving readable style will be revealed.  Also, a list of web sites for further reading will be provided.

Version control systems will be discussed and you will see that even if you're a single developer, everyone can benefit from using one.

Most importantly, YOU will have a part in sharing your experiences, both good and bad. Come join in the discussion and learn from your colleagues.
