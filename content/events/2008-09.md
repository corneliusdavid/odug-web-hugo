Several months back, we had a meeting on XML and I promised a "Part II" that would go into web services. That will finally be fulfilled at our next regular semi-monthly meeting.

There will be a brief introduction to web services, what they are, and who might be using them. Then we'll get into the code by creating three web services in Delphi 2006, each increasing in complexity, and each with a VCL client to use them.  The differences between an ISAPI DLL and a CGI stand-alone executable will be explained, the Web App Debugger that comes with Delphi will be demonstrated, and some samples of actual web service data from a real life ecommerce project will be shown.

Sound like too much for two hours? With Delphi, web services are a snap! And the steps are surprisingly similar from Delphi 6 to Delphi 2007. But there are some tips you'll want to know....
