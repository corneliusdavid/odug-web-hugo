## TOPIC ##

[ModelMaker](http://www.modelmaker.demon.nl/mm.htm) is a modeling / UML tool written in Delphi for Delphi which provides fast class design, diagramming, and code generation. It can also import  existing units, provides a structured differencing engine, and can apply templates and patterns to class designs. The presenter has no vested interest in ModelMaker, but has found it to be an invaluable tool. Also demonstrated is the [ModelMaker Code Explorer](http://www.modelmaker.demon.nl/mm.htm), which is a Delphi plug-in that provides a subset/superset of ModelMaker functionality directly to Delphi.

The presentation will begin with a simple object and test application. The object will be examined and discussed. At this point, the unit containing the object will be discarded, and will be recreated live using ModelMaker. After the break, the difference engine, documentation support, and  customizable features will be discussed.
