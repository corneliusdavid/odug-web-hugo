Come see the **Ultimate Delphi** at your local user group and learn everything about Delphi 2005 for .NET, Win32 and C#, including but not limited to, refactoring, unit testing, Enterprise Core Objects II, etc, etc. 

The list of incredibly cool stuff in this feature packed release just goes on and on.

You don't want to miss this chance to see it all, and be able to win a copy, as well as getting a show special. That's right, a special price for just you - and that's not all. You'll get other cool stuff too - how does a T-shirt sound? 

What are you waiting for? Get your calendar out and pencil this date in, or punch it into your cell phone or PDA now!
