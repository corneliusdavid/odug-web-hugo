## PRESENTER ##

We are delighted to have as our special, out-of-town guest, **Chad Hower**, Vice President of Engineering for Nevrona Designs. Chad was a featured speaker at the 11th Annual Borland Conference this summer in San Diego and his presentation on Internet, Sockets, and TCP/IP Programming and Development was so popular that a second presentation had to be scheduled.

Chad Hower's programming career started in 1981 at Pennsylvania State University. He has since mastered more languages than a United Nations translator and is an expert 
in multiple operating systems, databases, and protocols. Chad's professional excellence and contributions won him the Technical Assistance Recognition Award (C++ Builder) 
from Inprise /Borland. He also writes for Delphi Magazine and VB Online in his spare time.

Nevrona Designs is a company rooted in the future, who creates unique possibilities for their customers. Nevrona is committed to providing solutions to those on the cutting 
edge of technology.
