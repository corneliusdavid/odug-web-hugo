## TOPIC ##

This month, the trials and tribulations of creating and running DLLs in Delphi will be discussed. We will talk about whether or not you really need DLLs, how to handle versioning, and interface design.

## PRESENTER ## 

**Gene Juhos** of Sysmatics started his programming career writing code for an IBM 3741. He's written useful code in COBOL, FORTRAN, C, C++, Assembler, CADOL and lately mostly Delphi. He took his first Delphi training class in 1996 using Delphi 3. Currently, Sysmatics supports a mix of customers on UNIX, Novell, and Microsoft networks. They convert old green screen applications to Delphi.
