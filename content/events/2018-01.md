For the discussion tonight, we'll briefly touch on the latest update to Delphi which was 10.2.2. 

Since it's the first meeting of 2018 we will also focus on what we're all doing with Delphi (if anything) and what kinds of discussions would be best to focus on this year. I don't want to spend too much time talking about features that are hardly even marginally useful to any of us and focus on what is useful.
