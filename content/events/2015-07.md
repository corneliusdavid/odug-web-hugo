<h3>TOPIC</h3>

<p>
Recently, the <a href="https://www.occa.org/">OCCA</a>'s monthly meeting was on My Favorite App. It was a roaring success and sounded like a good idea for this group. So this month, our topic will be on a similar vein, but with a focus on developer tools. This will be an open forum led by David Cornelius but with the hope that each attendee will have something to share.
</p>

<p>
To help generate some ideas, tools could cover (but are not limited to): source control, code compare, deployment management, script editors, macro libraries, search tips, programming aids, keyboard short-cuts, IDE plugins, or database analyzers. 
</p>

<p>
We all should be able to learn something!
