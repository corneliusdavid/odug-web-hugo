## TOPIC ##

Recently, the [OCCA](https://www.occa.org)'s monthly meeting was on My Favorite App. It was a roaring success and sounded like a good idea for this group. So this month, our topic will be on a similar vein, but with a focus on developer tools. This will be an open forum led by David Cornelius but with the hope that each attendee will have something to share.

To help generate some ideas, tools could cover (but are not limited to): source control, code compare, deployment management, script editors, macro libraries, search tips, programming aids, keyboard short-cuts, IDE plugins, or database analyzers. 

We all should be able to learn something!
