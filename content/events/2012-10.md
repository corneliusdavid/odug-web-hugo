TOPIC

Many people do not know, and fewer still actually use, a nifty feature which appeared in the Delphi IDE a few years ago: built-in XML Documentation for your source code.

At this month's meeting, we'll show how to turn it on, how to use it, and how it can enhance developer productivity, especially if you are sharing libraries or have several units to which you are constantly referring to for reviewing a type or method.  There are very few articles on this subject, so come take advantage of the presenter's research and be more productive right away!
