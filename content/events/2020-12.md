<p>We don't usually meet in December but since there are so few holiday events which would normally take us out of our homes we have more time. Plus, many of us need&nbsp;an excuse to see others, if only to verify we're not alone. So we'll take an hour or two online during&nbsp;our normally scheduled third Wednesday and wish each other happy holidays and best wishes for a prosperous new year!</p>
