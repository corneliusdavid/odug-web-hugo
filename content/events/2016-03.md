This month we’ll just have a tech gab session, if that’s alright with everyone.  We could discuss further [last month’s topic](/2016-02), contemplate the meaning of [Idera](https://www.idera.com)’s [purchase of Embarcadero](https://forums.embarcadero.com/thread.jspa?threadID=117735) and what to make of their recent [announcement to focus exclusively on developer tools](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160309005199/en/Embarcadero-Announces-Dedicated-Developer-Strategy), show off a [latest gadget](http://www.cnet.com/pictures/all-the-cool-new-gadgets-at-ces-2016-pictures) you might have, or just brainstorm on what the [next killer app](https://medium.com/on-coding/the-formula-for-creating-the-next-killer-app-bad2c9d88449#.bt55kv5mq) might be.
