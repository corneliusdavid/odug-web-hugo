**Firebird** is a relational database offering many ANSI SQL-92 features that runs on Linux, Windows, and a variety of Unix platforms. It has been used in production systems, under a variety of names since 1981.

Much development has occured since Firebird rose from the ashes of the Open sourcing of Interbase.  In this presentation some of the topics we'll explore and demonstrate include:

- A brief history of Firebird/InterBase
- A review of Firebird's Features
- What's new since the open sourcing of InterBase
- What's new in the forthcoming release of Firebird 1.5
- What's on tap for the future
