## TOPIC ##

There will be no "formal" presentation, but we'll have a couple of laptops available and at least  one member will  be showing an  application that  "takes various text  files as input, formats them  into PDF invoices, statements,  etc. and delivers them  via email or fax to the customer."   We'd be interested to see what others are  working on as well, so please come and share.

## PRESENTER ##
