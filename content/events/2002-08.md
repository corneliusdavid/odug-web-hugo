## TOPIC ##

This year's Borland Conference, BorCon 2002, highlighted .NET and the exploding Web Services market.  Anders Hejlsberg, a former Borland employee now spearheading the C# language and a key participant of the .NET framework at Microsoft, gave Monday's keynote talk and announced Delphi 7 coming later this year. These and other highlights will be shared at the June meeting by a panel of BorCon attendees from Oregon.  If you couldn't attend BorCon, you *gotta* come to ODUG this month!
