<h3>TOPIC</h3>

<p>
A few years ago, David Cornelius, coordinator for this group, threatened to leave the Portland area and move to California.  Indeed, he had a job there and traveled there quite often, but never really left.
</p>

<p>
Well, once again, David has accepted a job in another state, this time in Washington. It's more likely this time that his move is imminent and will be permanent. Thus, coordination of these meetings will necessarily fall to those who remain and are interested in seeing it continue.
</p>

<p>
Discussion of what it takes to run this group and who may be interested in taking over the simple management of the meeting room and topics presented will be the focus of this month's meeting.
