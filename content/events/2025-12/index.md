It's that time of year again!  Yep, [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is back! How many puzzles can you solve before the meeting? 

<!--more-->

[Last year](https://odug.org/events/2024-12/), we discussed various solutions to several of the programming puzzles published every December. This year, we'll do it again--but I'm going to use a different language other than Delphi (to be revealed at the meeting!).

I'd like to challenge each of you to tackle a few of them as well and we can share solutions, discuss various approaches, and laugh at all the AoC memes you can find on Reddit!
