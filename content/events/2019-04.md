<h3>TOPIC</h3>
<p>
We'll have a short presentation of how to send SMS messages from a Delphi app. There isn't much to it but might be interesting for some.
</p>

<p>
We'll fill the rest of the time by covering any previous topics that you'd like. If you've missed a recent ODUG meeting and would like to ask questions or see demos of things that have been missed, come to this meeting and we'll dig stuff out of archives and get you caught up.  (If you <a href="https://corneliusconcepts.com/contact">send a note to the presenter</a>, he'll make sure to get your questions prepared early to save time during the meeting.)
</p>

<h3>PRESENTERS</h3>
<strong>Homer Jones</strong> sells insurance agency management software through his company <a href="http://agencybusys.com/">Agency Business Systems</a>. He has been adding features to his application, written in Delphi, for a long time and will show us his latest addition: sending SMS messages.

<strong>David Cornelius</strong> is a contract software developer building applications for almost any platform, creating client/server and mobile apps, e-commerce integrations for Retail Pro. He writes mostly in Delphi, some in .NET, and uses several web technologies. You can read more about him at <a href="https://corneliusconcepts.com/">Cornelius Concepts, LLC</a>.
