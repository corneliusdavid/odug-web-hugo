We'll have a short presentation of how to send SMS messages from a Delphi app. There isn't much to it but might be interesting for some.

We'll fill the rest of the time by covering any previous topics that you'd like. If you've missed a recent ODUG meeting and would like to ask questions or see demos of things that have been missed, come to this meeting and we'll dig stuff out of archives and get you caught up.  (If you [send a note to the presenter](https://corneliusconcepts.com/contact), he'll make sure to get your questions prepared early to save time during the meeting.)
