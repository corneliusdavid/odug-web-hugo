Embarcadero has a contest going on right now for [creating the most beautiful GUI with Skia for Delphi](https://blogs.embarcadero.com/skia4delphi-gui-beauty-contest). Skia is a 2D graphics engine, sponsored by Google, that provides a common API across various hardware and software platforms, including all the major web browsers.

A couple of smart guys in Brazil have created an open source library called, [Skia4Delphi](https://github.com/skia4delphi) to make this API work in both VCL and Firemonkey applications. We'll run their sample programs and perhaps even show some of our own creations at the June meeting.
