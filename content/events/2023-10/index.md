RAD Server is an Extendable REST Server in a box. You install it and immediately have a REST service with authentication and customizable API calls that can be written in Delphi. We'll be using Delphi 11 Alexandria to showcase RAD Server 4.2, how to install it, how to write modules for it, and how to test and deploy it.

As the title says, this is an introduction. We will follow this in another meeting with more advanced capabilities, such as downloading files, accessing databases, and posting updates. That will be followed with writing a mobile application to utilize the services we publish.

NOTE: This month's meeting is one week later than usual--the *fourth* Wednesday.
