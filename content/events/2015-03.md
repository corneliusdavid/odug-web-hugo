A little over a year ago, we discussed [one application](http://odug.org/2013-09) in several different languages covering Delphi, C#, Oxygene and even JavaScript. It's very unusual that a company would want to do this in real life given they'd have to support several different languages, but it made for some interesting discussions and comparisons. Usually, a company attempts to minimize the number of supported environments to prevent fractured development teams and keep support costs down. Many software tools over the years have promised write-once/build-or-run-anywhere solutions.  That's the promise of Delphi but it doesn't support all platforms and not everyone is satisfied with how Android and iOS are supported.

Tonight, we'll look at an advanced language that really does build applications for every major platform today: [Oxygene](http://www.elementscompiler.com/elements/oxygene/default.aspx).

Oxygene is an Object Pascal-based language from RemObjects Software that works inside Visual Studio to build a wide variety of types of applications.  From console-based utilities to .NET Windows Forms applications to  ASP.NET web sites to mobile apps on Windows, iOS, and Android, you can use one IDE and one modern programming language to support them all! (And if you don't like Pascal, they also offer [C# and Swift](http://www.elementscompiler.com/elements/default.aspx) compilers!)

This will be part one of a two-part session and may extend into a third if there is enough interest for some of the advanced concepts. We'll start with the idea of a Shared Project in Oxygene and show how your platform-agnostic classes can be shared among all your projects without creating DLLs or copying your code.

Then we'll show the built-in support for unit testing and move quickly into a simple console application. Next, we'll build a familiar .NET Windows application using WPF. If there's time, we'll show the Windows Phone app as well which has many similarities to the WPF application since they both use XAML.

Our next session will cover ASP.NET and Android and possibly iOS (depending on the resources available--a Mac is required for building an iOS app).

**David Cornelius** keeps very busy in his [day job](http://www.wideorbit.com) adding features and fixing bugs in large Windows applications written in Delphi. In off hours, he can often be found exploring new features of Oxygene or fiddling with a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org). You can read more about him at [Cornelius Concepts](http://corneliusconcepts.com).
