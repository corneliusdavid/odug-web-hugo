<h3>TOPIC</h3>

<p>
This is Part II to August's topic in a way because we will be looking at a different way to get your legacy applications to run through a browser. However, this time we'll be looking at a different product from the same company that provided Thinfinity VirtualUI. There are cases where that scenario doesn't quite cut it. Cybele Software provides another solution, <a href="https://www.cybelesoft.com/thinfinity/remote-desktop/server/">Thinfinity Remote Desktop Server</a>.
</p>

<p>
There are many Remote Desktop clients and other ways to access remote desktops through a browser.  We will briefly explore options, then dive into the configuration details of Cybele Software's offering.
</p>

<h3>PRESENTER</h3>

<strong>David Cornelius</strong> is a software developer building applications for almost any platform, creating e-commerce integrations for Retail Pro, and enabling Windows applications to run in the cloud from any HTML5-enabled browser. He writes in Delphi, C#, and uses several web technologies. You can read more about him at <a href="https://corneliusconcepts.com">Cornelius Concepts, LLC</a>.
