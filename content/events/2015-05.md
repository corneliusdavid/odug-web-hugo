<h3>TOPIC</h3>

<p>
In March, we introduced the concept of <a href="http://odug.org/2015-03">Shared Projects using Oxygene</a>, a Pascal compiler that works inside Visual Studio and generates applications for all the major platforms--including Windows Phone.
</p>

<p>
This month, we'll continue that exploration by branching away from the Windows desktop and take a look at how the same shared classes we used previously can also help us build ASP.NET web sites and Android apps.
</p>

<h4>CODE</h4>

<p>
The code for everything demonstrated during both parts of this presentation is on <a href="https://github.com/corneliusdavid/PrimeQuery/tree/shared__class">GitHub</a>.  Feel free to download make suggestions or improvements.
