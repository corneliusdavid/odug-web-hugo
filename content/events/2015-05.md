## TOPIC ##

In March, we introduced the concept of [Shared Projects using Oxygene](http://odug.org/2015-03), a Pascal compiler that works inside Visual Studio and generates applications for all the major platforms--including Windows Phone.

This month, we'll continue that exploration by branching away from the Windows desktop and take a look at how the same shared classes we used previously can also help us build ASP.NET web sites and Android apps.

## CODE ##

The code for everything demonstrated during both parts of this presentation is on [GitHub](https://github.com/corneliusdavid/PrimeQuery/tree/shared__class).  Feel free to download make suggestions or improvements.

## PRESENTER ##
