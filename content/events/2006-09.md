## TOPIC ##

In our continuing exploration on other programming langages and platforms, we cannot ignore Java.  By using the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), the programmer can write once and run (almost) everywhere--at least more places than .NET can currently boast.  Developers can write GUI client apps, enhance web pages, and build back-end server systems.  Perhaps one of the more appealing aspects for Delphi Developers is the fact that Java is stronly typed and fully object-oriented.

This month's presentation will start off with a brief PowerPoint overview of Java.  The difference between Application, Applet, and Servlet/JSP will be explained (with a heavier focus on the web server platform).   Eclipse and Tomcat will be used for development, and you will see how those pieces fit together and how to set up a web project.

Following that, a Black Jack application will be demonstrated.  It uses the MVC (model view controller) pattern; each piece will be explained along with how they interact.
