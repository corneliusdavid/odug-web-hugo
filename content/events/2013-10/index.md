Embarcadero's Delphi XE5 Tour!

*The evening event has been CANCELLED! Instead, you are invited to Ruth's Chris Steak House in Portland at noon.*  Because there were two events on this date and far many more people registered with Embarcadero for the noon event than the evening event, Embarcadero has eliminated the evening one.  There will not be any meeting at the Fanno Creek Brew Pub in December.

At this technical and interactive session, attendees will:

- See Android and iOS true native apps built from a single code base
- See multi-device, true native development tools in action  
- Talk with development experts on how you can make the move to mobile today

Follow this link to learn more and register for this **mid-day** [Android and iOS Meet and Eat](http://forms.embarcadero.com/AMUSCA13Q4RADXE5Tour-Portland) event. Lunch will be provided.
