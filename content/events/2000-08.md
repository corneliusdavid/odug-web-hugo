We hear a lot about multitier applications and Borland's Multitier Distributed Application Services Suite (MIDAS) is an excellent tool to create and deliver them with Delphi.  Come hear an introductory level presentation of the benefits Delphi developers have using MIDAS to implement their multitier solutions.  We will discuss the purpose and use of various MIDAS components, general information about multitier application design, and walk through the code of a small multitier application.

PRESENTER:

Rob Schuff is a local software engineer with over 3 years of Delphi experience. His current position involves all maintainance and enhancements to multiple Midas applications.
