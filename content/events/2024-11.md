Tonight we'll look at a batch script that calls three command-line utilities which perform a lot of tedious work of migrating legacy Delphi 5 programs to compile under Delphi 12. The old code base uses the BDE and a lot of custom components; the new code uses FireDAC and Raize Controls and Quantumn Grid from DevExpress--a huge jump in functionality and improvement in user interface!

The  code base relies on a large set of libraries and custom components that have been manually updated and are already in place in Delphi 12. These provide a database abstract layer to hide many of the details; still there were several important differences handled almost completely by the scripts.

Come an watch a live demo of the conversion process of one of the smaller programs!
