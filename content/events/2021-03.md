Various topics concerning testing will be discussed this month, including types of testing (e.g. Unit Testing or Integration Testing). Jonathan Eaton will highlight these differences, sharing strengths and weaknesses and when to use which types. David Cornelius will demonstrate the DUnit test framework in Delphi.

**Jonathan Eaton** is a Delphi programmer, an author, and an ASQ certified software quality engineer. He spent about three years implementing and maintaining an FDA-compliant QM process for the software development of what the FDA would consider a “software component of a medical device”–in this case, a Delphi application, and later a website, that patients and clinicians could use to download and analyze patient data recorded by blood glucose meters and insulin pumps.
