Tonight's topic title indicates getting out in the trenches of Delphi development--and that's exactly where we'll be. David Cornelius will share his experience of working on a project that has several interesting aspects.  The application utilizes TurboPower's [Async Pro](http://www.turbopower.com/products/apro/) serial port communications library, takes a screen-shot of another application using Windows API calls, has custom-written components (both visual and non-visual), and uses some new features of the recently released [Raize Components](http://www.raize.com/DevTools/Default.htm) version 3.  The format will be loose and we'll be in the code most of the evening, following a general structure, but exploring deeper those areas the audience is most interested in.

David Cornelius has been using Borland's software tools for over 15 years, using mostly the Object Pascal language. He is currently employed at [Oregon Health & Science University](http://gcrc.ohsu.edu/) developing software for researchers using [Delphi](http://www.borland.com/delphi) and [Firebird](http://www.firebirdsql.org).  In his spare time, he develops more software through his contracting business, [Cornelius Concepts](http://corneliusconcepts.com), using Delphi and [DBISAM](http://www.elevatesoft.com/prodinfo.htm).
