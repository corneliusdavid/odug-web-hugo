## TOPIC ##

The Open Data Protocol ([OData](http://www.odata.org)) is a Web protocol for querying and updating data that provides a way to unlock your data and free it from silos that exist in applications today. We'll see how an old technology in Delphi, WebBroker, has been able to do this for quite some time, but now there's a cool name and a formalized protocol for it.  A sample Delphi application will make obvious how simple it is to open your data to mobile devices!
