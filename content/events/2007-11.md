Quality Assurance is the elusive goal of every product manager--and the bane of every programmer.  OK, I don't know that for sure, but producing bug-free applications can drive a programmer crazy if he has to work with loose guidelines or tight time-constraints.  But aren't those both par for the course?

This month's format will be a little different.  There will be an introduction by David Cornelius, focus on examples with Chris Newcombe, then the audience is encouraged to share their "worst bug ever" and how they overcame it.  Some tips and tricks for preventing bugs will be explored, and finally, a couple of Delphi libraries that can help hunt down the ones that slip through.

Please come, listen and share as we strive for better software development practices.
