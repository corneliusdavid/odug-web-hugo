TOPIC

Are you yearning for capabilities or libraries that you see available for .NET but have a solid Delphi application that you don't want to throw away?  Would you like to start a new .NET application and utilize large sections of code or a third-party library you have in Delphi? Or what if you just want to add a plug-in architecture to your application (either .NET or Delphi) that allows for the eventual possibility of incorporating the other environment?

With [Hydra](http://www.remobjects.com/hydra) you can have this today! This is not a free product, but one purchase price (from RemObjects Software) gives you support for Delphi 7-XE6 and Visual Studio 2008 and up plus starts a one-year subscription of updates and support.

In tonight's meeting, you will learn how to take an existing Delphi application and add Hydra support, first to incorporate a Delphi plug-in, then to load a .NET plug-in. You'll also see the same concepts applied to an existing .NET application to give you the flexibility to start with either platform. Both visual and non-visual plugins will be demonstrated.

The development tools used will be Delphi 2010 and [Oxygene](http://www.remobjects.com/elements/oxygene/) (inside Visual Studio 2013).

CODE

The code for the main demo from this presentation is on [GitHub](https://github.com/corneliusdavid/HydraDemos).  Feel free to download and play with it as you would like.

PRESENTER

David Cornelius keeps threatening to leave the area--and the chance of that happening are increasing.  But when he's available, he's still very much a part of this group. While his day job doesn't involve .NET at all, he has a keen interest in the technology. He has been developing software since the mid-80's and currently works on Delphi and JavaScript applications for [WideOrbit](http://www.wideorbit.com).  You can read more about him at [Cornelius Concepts](http://corneliusconcepts.com).
