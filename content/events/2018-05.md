<h3>TOPIC</h3>

<p>
We've talked a lot about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)">SOLID</a> principles of software development over the last couple of months.  The last letter, D, stands for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150905081103/http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/dip.pdf">Dependency Inversion</a>.  We'll discuss this with examples and talk about the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sglienke/spring4d.git">Spring</a> library and how its <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/130794/what-is-dependency-injection">Dependency <i>Injection</i></a> plays into this--if you do it right!
</p>

<h3>PRESENTER</h3>

<p>
Ron Grove will again lead the discussion, based in large part on his deep knowledge of the subject having read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445">the book</a> the SOLID principles were based on before the acronym was coined.
