## TOPIC ##

We've talked a lot about the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) principles of software development over the last couple of months.  The last letter, **D**, stands for [Dependency Inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle).  We'll discuss this with examples and talk about the [Spring](https://bitbucket.org/sglienke/spring4d.git) library and how its [Dependency *Injection*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/130794/what-is-dependency-injection) plays into this--if you do it right!

## PRESENTER ##

**Ron Grove** will again lead the discussion, based in large part on his deep knowledge of the subject having read [the book](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445) the SOLID principles were based on before the acronym was coined.
