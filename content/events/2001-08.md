## TOPIC ##

How many Environment or Editor options have you looked at?  Do you have any Delphi Plug-ins installed? 

David will explain how enhancing Delphi 5's IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, has helped him increase productivity. Two plug-ins, [GExperts](http://www.gexperts.org/) and [CodeRush](http://www.eagle-software.com/)>, will show the incredible power of this RAD environment and expand your idea of productivity.

## PRESENTER ##
