In [October of 2023](https://odug.org/events/2023-10/), the concepts of building RAD Server modules were introduced with the promise of a more advanced topic "soon". Well, next month, we will finally dive into the deep end but this month a refresh of that introductory topic will be shared along with a quick database demo that produces a JSON list of customers. Additionally, a quick show-and-tell of an Android app written with the popular JavaScript framework, [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) will demonstrate how the JSON data produced is used.

This session will show some live customer data so it will not be recorded. The plan for next month is to use a test database with fictional data that we can show to a broader audience.

## PRESENTERS ##

[DAVID CORNELIUS](https://corneliusconcepts.tech/aboutme) will talk about RAD Server and show the Delphi code for building the RAD Server module. He is a professional programmer and an Embarcadero MVP, working with Delphi both at his full-time [job](https://www.cascadegovsoftware.com/) and in his own [business](https://corneliusconcepts.com/). He also builds websites and dabbles with Linux.

HOMER JONES will share his experience getting up to speed with JavaScript and the tools necessary to build an Android app and use the published JSON data. He is currently the President of [Agency Business Systems, Incorporated](https://agencybusys.com/), a Portland-based company providing business management software to the Insurance Industry. He has been programming with Delphi since it was first released 30 years ago.
