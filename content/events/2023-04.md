## TOPIC ##

The Delphi IDE's Welcome Page was completely revamped with Delphi 11 and it now supports custom plug-ins. There haven't been very many written and there's even less documentation about how to do it but I dug into the samples and figured out a few things.

At tonight's meeting, we'll look at the three sample Welcome Page plug-ins that come with Delphi, show how to make simple modifications to get our feet wet, then show how we can copy one to turn it into something useful.
