With no end in sight to quarantine restrictions for indoor gatherings, we're going to meet online in October. A link will be provided a week before the meeting, which will be back to our regular schedule: **6:00 PM the third Wednesday of the month**.

We won't have a specific topic but will just have an open discussion of how this strange year has affected your business or career. We may also look at the new features of the latest version of Delphi, 10.4 Sydney if people are interested.

Looking forward to seeing you all again!
