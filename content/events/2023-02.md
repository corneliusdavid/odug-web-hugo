## TOPIC ##

February's meeting will be somewhat unstructured. Someone mentioned wanting to learn more about the **Delphi IDE** so, we'll look at the different parts of that and discuss how this powerful environment can enhance your productivity. This year's [**DelphiCon**](https://lp.embarcadero.com/DelphiCon2023) is in progress so we'll review some of the topics being discussed. 

We'll also take a look at a small program in Go written to help automate parts of a website being built.

## PRESENTER ##

[**David Cornelius**](https://corneliusconcepts.tech/aboutme) is a full-time Delphi developer and has been programming since the 1980s.
