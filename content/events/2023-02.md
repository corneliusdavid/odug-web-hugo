February's meeting will be somewhat unstructured. Someone mentioned wanting to learn more about the **Delphi IDE** so, we'll look at the different parts of that and discuss how this powerful environment can enhance your productivity. This year's [**DelphiCon**](https://lp.embarcadero.com/DelphiCon2023) is in progress so we'll review some of the topics being discussed. 

We'll also take a look at a small program in Go I wrote to help automate parts of a website I'm building.
