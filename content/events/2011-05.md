This month, the Oregon Delphi User Group will be looking at integrating help into Delphi applications.  [Just Great Software](http://www.just-great-software.com) produces a complete help authoring tool called, [HelpScribble](http://www.helpscribble.com) that simplifies the task of producing help files and manuals in multiple formats.  These files can be used to provide context-sensitive help in your Delphi programs, stand-alone software manuscripts, or even online documentation--all from the same help project file.

## PRESENTERS ##

The discussion leaders are long-time members of this group, **Homer Jones** and **Dan Lowe**.  There are likely others that have experience with this or other help authoring products and we welcome their comments.
