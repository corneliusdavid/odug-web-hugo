[Digital Metaphors](http://www.digital-metaphors.com), the publishers of ReportBuilder, are sponsoring the pizza for this event in exchange for us showing off their product.  And they have a very good product!  Practically the standard for reporting under Delphi, ReportBuilder is a powerful design tool for creating complex reports. **There will be several trial copies of ReportBuilder to hand out, and one lucky person will get a full, licensed copy of ReportBuilder Pro, a $500 Value!**

In October, we learned about RaveReports from Chad Hower of [Nevrona Designs](http://www.nevrona.com/). Recently released, this is the vastly reworked version of ReportPrinter Pro 3.  We will see some of the demos and get a first-impression look at the product.

If time allows and interest is there, we'll also take a peek at how to get around some of the pitfalls of using [QuickReport](http://www.qusoft.com/), the free reporting tool that comes with Delphi.
