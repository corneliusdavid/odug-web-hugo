Did anyone "attend" the virtual CodeGear conference last week, CodeRage?  There were some good sessions, although I didn't have time to listen in on all I wanted to.  If you missed any of them, they're all available at the [CodeRage web site](http://conferences.codegear.com/coderage07).

The topic this month is just a loose discussion around Borland/CodeGear and speculation about how they'll do this year.  Delphi 2007 for Win32 was announced on Friday and has several really nice features and improvements.  It's supposedly faster than Delphi 7, has much better and faster help, is a non-breaking update (no need to purchase upgrades from your 2006 3rd-party controls), supports Vista glass frames (among other features), and includes a major update to dbExpress.

There's been a flurry of blogs about it and I think the company is doing a pretty good job of evangelizing and pumping up excitement about it.  My favorite article so far is: [this](http://www.bangkokpost.com/140307_Database/14Mar2007_data01.php) one. You can find blog links, news, and lots of information on the [CodeGear](http://codegear.com) web site.

As always, I'll have my laptop with BDS 2006 along with some 3rd-party components and tools if anyone tires of talking and wants to get into the code.

PRESENTER:
