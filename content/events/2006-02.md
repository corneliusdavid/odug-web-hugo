## TOPIC ##

**FinalBuilder** is a powerful Automated Build & Release Management tool which makes it easy for software developers to define and maintain a reliable and repeatable build process. FinalBuilder includes integration with version control systems, file and directory operations, iterators, source code compilers, testing tools, database systems, installation tools, as well as actions for deployment over the Internet and CD/DVD burning built in.

Don't forget we'd like to give away a free license of FinalBuilder 4 Professional worth $499 as a door prize.
