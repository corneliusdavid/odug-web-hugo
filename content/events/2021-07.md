We're meeting in person at the old familiar place!

A couple of things will likely be discussed at our meeting:

- Delphi's new <a href="https://blogs.embarcadero.com/delphi-cbuilder-community-editions-now-available-in-version-10-4-2/">Community Edition based on Delphi 10.4.2</a>
- A quick look at <a href="https://getitnow.embarcadero.com/bonus-radiant-shapes/">Radiant Shapes</a> and a discussion about other shape libraries.
