We're meeting in person at the old familiar place!

## TOPIC ##

A couple of things will likely be discussed at our meeting:

- Delphi's new [Community Edition based on Delphi 10.4.2](https://blogs.embarcadero.com/delphi-cbuilder-community-editions-now-available-in-version-10-4-2)
- A quick look at [Radiant Shapes](https://getitnow.embarcadero.com/bonus-radiant-shapes) and a discussion about other shape libraries.
