TOPIC

Crystal Reports is a reporting application that can access data from a wide array of sources. It has come bundled with both Delphi and Visual Studio and is now also available as a web-based application. Many people have used Crystal Reports with Delphi through the years.

Tonight's presentation will be by a company that has been using Crystal Reports since Delphi 3.  Crystal 8.5, no longer supported, was the last version that let you install a free runtime for every user.  It was also the last version that had a VCL SDK. Newer versions of Crystal require either a report server or full installation of Crystal Reports on each workstation. This can get expensive.  And the Crystal user interface for entering parameters is really clunky.

So a better and cheaper alternative was sought. This led to the discovery of DataLink Viewer and Visual Cut from [Millet Software](http://milletsoftware.com/).  Gene Juhos from Sysmatics would like to demo how he uses these products.

ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION

There is increasing interest in developing cross-support agreements between ODUG members to provide backup programmer assurance for clients worried about their software being developed by a single person. We will explore various methods this can be accomplished after the main presentation.
