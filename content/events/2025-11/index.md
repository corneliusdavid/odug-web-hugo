Everyone is talking about AI these days. Many use AI to help with their programming. But what if you want the software you write to use AI or provide an AI interface to its users? Are your customers clamoring for AI-enabled apps? Are you afraid of losing business if you don't add it? What will it do?

We'll answer many of these questions at tonight's meeting--and show ways to add AI capabilities to an old Delphi application!

If it isn't already, artificial intelligence (AI) will soon be a requirement in every business application. Employers want productive workers, but resist interrupting their regular duties to learn new software. If the job (or the software) is complicated, training is even more critical. It's hard for seasoned employees to learn enhancements or program updates, but what about new hires? It becomes even more of an issue when the software is sophisticated or serves a complex industry. That's where AI is changing the workplace.
 
Applications that offer a well-constructed AI interface allow employees to ask how to do a particular task. They don't need to ask their supervisor or drag another employee away from their work. They can ask the application what to do using plain English language. In some cases, they can just tell the app to do something. No need to learn complicated tasks when AI can do it. In simple terms, just say something like, “Tell me which of our existing customers might buy XYZ product?”, or “Which supplier's product has ABC features?” Think of the impact of creating complicated queries or custom reports.
 
Homer Jones is adding that kind of capability to his application, and will demonstrate what it takes to add real AI automation to an existing Delphi application. He will cover: 
- deciding what features can be automated
- how to teach AI about the application
- developing tools that teach AI how to understand typical user questions
- how to cause AI responses to be correctly limited to the application
- and what role AI will play when dealing with the end user

You will see a live demonstration of real AI applied to a legacy application, and some of the code that runs behind the scenes.
