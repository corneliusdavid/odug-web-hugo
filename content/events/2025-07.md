Homer Jones will do a code review of a couple of projects he's been working on, one that imports CSV files and another that logs phone calls.

Both of these projects are directly related to his business and both are reported to have really slick user interfaces.

The Call Logging feature is for documenting incoming and outgoing calls from both clients and non-clients. It's written so future enhancements will work with caller ID for automatic logging.


## PRESENTER ##
