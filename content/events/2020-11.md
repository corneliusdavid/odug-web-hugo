Thanksgiving is a time for thankfulness and sharing. For our November meeting, we'll give each attendee an opportunity to share something they've done recently that might be interesting to the rest of the group and to mention something they're thankful for. This has been a crazy year and the goal is we'll encourage each other with cool technological feats or accomplishments.

Hopefully, some of these activities will involve Delphi somehow but we're going to leave it open. Join us online the third Wednesday evening.

See you then!
