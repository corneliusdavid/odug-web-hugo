PHP - that's the P from LAMP  - is essentially a scripting language used inside HTML code to build dynamic web pages. Tonight's talk will be an introduction to PHP. Examples of different coding structures will be given, presented from the perspective of what the PHP equivalent is to the familiar Delphi structures. To illustrate these concepts in a practical way we'll go through the steps to build a simple website for a small store. Along the way we'll also be touching on the A and M from LAMP - the Apache Web server and MySQL database. Software willing, by 8:00 we'll have a web storefront with dynamic content running on a laptop!
