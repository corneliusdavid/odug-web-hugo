This month, we have a short demonstration of [SecureBridge](https://www.devart.com/sbridge), another great product by DevArt. This small set of components makes setting up SSH and SFTP client and server connections a breeze and the latest version supports all the new security-enhanced protocols required by today's increased standards.

## DOOR PRIZE! ##

Once again, [DevArt](http://www.devart.com), a database component and tools vendor for Delphi and .NET, is sponsoring our meeting! One lucky attendee, picked at random from those who submit their name and email, will be eligible for one free license of either SecureBridge or a Delphi Data Access Product from the DevArt Store! 

## PRESENTER ##

**David Cornelius** has used SecureBridge to save many days of anguish in trying to understand and control internet security protocols and how the Indy components use them to provide SFTP capabilities in Delphi programs. He has been programming since the IBM PC came out and currently writes XML transformations for lending institutions as an employee of [eLynx](http://elynx.com). Read more about him at [Cornelius Concepts](http://corneliusconcepts.com).
