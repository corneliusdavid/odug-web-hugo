Coding is changing shape and we will show you the future tonight! 

<!--more-->

Using AI to help with research and documentation and testing has become a standard part of a developer's daily job over the last year but in the last couple of months, AI's capabilities has taken a dramatic leap. The latest versions of both Claude and ChatGPT are now being heralded by many as moving us from developers to product managers. Some are saying it's the end of coding, many are skeptical.

Using Claude Code, we will attempt to build a working Delphi Windows app from scratch without writing a line of code ourselves. To keep it simple and familiar, we'll use the VCL and a sample SQLite database. It won't be a terribly complicated application (we only have an hour!) but it will use a third-party component or two, perform some manipulation of data, and show some refactoring of the project, all live and with audience suggestions.
