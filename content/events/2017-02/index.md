## TOPIC ##

[DevArt Software](https://www.devart.com) is once again sponsoring our meeting and will offer the standard 20% discount and one product license give-a-way to a randomly chosen attendee. We will have a discussion about their [Data Access Tools](https://www.devart.com/dac.html), or DAC for short.  I will show some demos, some prepared by DevArt, some written by myself. They will cover SQLServer, SQLite, VirtualTable, and MySQL database connections.

We will also have some audience participation to cover Firebird support through IBDAC and will touch on Oracle considerations. Anyone with experience in DevArt database connection products is welcome and encouraged to share your experience.

## PRESENTERS ##

**David Cornelius** works as an Implementation Engineer for [Black Knight Origination Technologies Division](http://www.bkfs.com/OriginationTechnology/Pages/default.aspx) but keeps his hand in the development circles by working on Delphi and web applications whenever he can through his business, [Cornelius Concepts](http://corneliusconcepts.com).

**Homer Jones** and **Ron Grove** will add to the discussion by sharing their experiences with Firebird and Oracle.
