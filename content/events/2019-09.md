<h3>TOPICS</h3>

<p>
In July, we had a Delphi MVP briefly cover a variety of topics, one of them was <a href="https://github.com/andrea-magni/MARS">MARS Curiosity</a>, the open source REST server framework written by <a href="https://www.andreamagni.eu/">Andrea Magni</a>. This month, Glenn Dufke is back and will dive more deeply into that framework.
</p>

<p>
Further back this year, we explored another open source web server project, <a href="https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework">DMVC Framework</a>, written by <a href="http://www.danieleteti.it/">Daniele Teti</a>, and will bring this out as time allows to compare the two.
</p>

<p>
Both of these web frameworks ease the work of getting a web server built in Delphi serving REST APIs to web and mobile clients. Come see the demos, ask questions, and decide which one is best for you!
