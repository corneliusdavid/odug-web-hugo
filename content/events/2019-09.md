## TOPICS ##

In July, we had a Delphi MVP briefly cover a variety of topics, one of them was [MARS Curiosity](https://github.com/andrea-magni/MARS), the open source REST server framework written by [Andrea Magni](https://www.andreamagni.eu). This month, Glenn Dufke is back and will dive more deeply into that framework.

Further back this year, we explored another open source web server project, [DMVC Framework](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework), written by [Daniele Teti](http://www.danieleteti.it), and will bring this out as time allows to compare the two.

Both of these web frameworks ease the work of getting a web server built in Delphi serving REST APIs to web and mobile clients. Come see the demos, ask questions, and decide which one is best for you!
