This session will cover some Delphi IDE tricks and tips as well as simple debugging techniques available in the IDE.  Most of the information for this presentation was gathered at two workshops Shawn attended during BorCon 2002, both presented by Brian Long.  Shawn will furnish examples of the tips, tricks and debugging techniques as well as provide links to Brian Long's web site, which has many more items of a similar nature available for Delphi developers.

PRESENTER:

Shawn Lehr is a Delphi developer for CorVel Corporation and, over the course of the last five years, has used Delphi 1, 3, 4, and 5. He does not consider himself a Delphi expert but is a huge fan of this unique programming tool and is excited about passing on this subtlely useful information to other Delphi developers.
