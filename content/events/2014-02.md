We'll explore Delphi XE5 a little more this evening and have a general chat on all things programming!

One idea is to explore some of the new VCL enhancements as noted in [David I's blog](http://blogs.embarcadero.com/davidi/2013/12/02/43032/).  Does anyone have experience using Delphi's Live Bindings?  I'd like to see how that compares with some of the XAML/WPF stuff I've been dealing with.
