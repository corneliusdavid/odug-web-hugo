*Experience the CodeGear products first-hand in Portland!*

You will be provided with a CodeGear update, as well as presentations and demonstations showcasing the new products.

As if the opportunity to check out our newest, coolest toys wasn't enough, we will also give all attendees a special product discount, and enter your name in a raffle for products and even an 80GB iPod!
