<p>
This month is going to be a "show and tell" with three different applications:
</p>
<ol>
<li>an Android application using Delphi and FireMonkey,</li>
<li>a insurance management program incorporating compiled resources,</li>
<li>a back-end integration using plug-in modules, REST APIs, and UniDAC accessing SQLite and MySQL.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The goal is to show, again, the variety of software that can be produced with Delphi. Hopefully, it will inspire questions and provide insight into topics that might be of interest for future meetings.
</p>

<h3>PRESENTERS</h3>

<ol><li>The android application will be shown by Gene Juhos of <a href="http://sysmatics.com">Sysmatics</a>, supporting small to mid-sized businesses with legacy software, database, reporting services.</li>
<li>Embedded resources will be explained by Homer Jones of <a href="http://agencybusys.com/">Agency Business Systems</a>, selling insurance agency management software nation-wide.</li>
<li>JSON and UniDAC will be shown by David Cornelius of <a href="http://corneliusconcepts.com/">Cornelius Concepts</a>, a contract software developer.</li>
</ol>
