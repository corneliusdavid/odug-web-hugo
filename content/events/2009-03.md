## TOPIC ##

Mark your calendar for **Wednesday**, **March 4**, 2009!

Anders Ohlsson from CodeGear will be at our group in Portland to talk about the latest Delphi products for both Windows 32 and .NET, show how to move your existing projects to the new environments, demonstrate modeling techniques to improve your code, and give you insight on rapidly creating web applications.

There will be discounts on Delphi 2009, C++Builder 2009, or RAD Studio 2009. And one lucky winner will walk away with a free copy of RAD Studio 2009 Pro!


Anders (aohlsson@embarcadero.com) is also looking for groups or companies that would like to meet privately, before the evening presentation. He is interested in meeting and speaking with development groups, discussing their project needs, and answering any questions about the company. Follow up with Anders directly if you are interested in one of these.

NOTE: We will meet in the Lorenzen Center Auditorium
