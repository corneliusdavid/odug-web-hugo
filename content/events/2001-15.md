David Cornelius and Homer Jones (ODUG coordinator and assistant) would like to present some ideas about growing the Oregon Delphi User Group into a larger, perhaps more formal organization.  Several ideas have been tossed around and we would like some discussion and feedback from you, the members of the group.  Please join us at 6:00 PM for this important meeting.  Pizza will be served and the regular meeting will follow.
