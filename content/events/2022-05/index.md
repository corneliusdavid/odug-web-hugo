## TOPIC ##

What kind of logging do you implement in your Delphi apps? Do you simply write out a few lines to a <code>.LOG</code> file? Or do you use a library that has detailed and highly structured logging for every action your users take?

What about remote usage reporting? If you distribute a desktop app, how do you know how many people use it and how often?

There's no one true way for everyone or every application. Join us tonight to share what works for you and hear ideas from others.
