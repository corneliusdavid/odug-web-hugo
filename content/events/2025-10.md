Have you heard about the JSON format but are not sure what it's for? Or perhaps you've been using a JSON library in your Delphi programs but are wondering if there's a better one.  October is the month we'll answer those questions!

<!--more-->

JSON, or **JavaScript Object Notation**, is a lightweight, text-based, human-readable format that uses key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects to exchange data among a wide variety of disparate systems. Unlike it's name, it doesn't really have anything to do with JavaScript but is completely language-independent. It is most known as the defacto format used by REST-based web services.

This month's meeting will involve three different speakers and cover not only the history and use of JSON with examples in Delphi but also compare various JSON libraries available.

More details will be provided as the date approaches.
