Inauguration Day, 2021. A new leader takes the helm of the U.S. amid a challenging pandemic and political upheaval. But technology has not stopped evolving and in fact has advanced faster than usual this last year to embrace the tremendous increase of people working from home but still needing to collaborate.

What's in store for you this year?

Homer Jones has added some error checking and an SMS feature to his Windows software hosted in the cloud. We will start our meeting with the scheduled BlueJeans meeting shown below, then switch to a Zoom meeting to allow him to show code from his development machine.
