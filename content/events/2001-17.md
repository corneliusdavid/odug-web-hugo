It's an understatement to say that there is a lot of excitement mounting for Borland's Delphi and C++Builder products on Linux.  Linux itself is nothing short of a phenomenon rising out of obscurity just a few years ago, to be the hottest topic in every computer-related periodical available. However, the biggest deficit of this free and stable operating system is the lack of applications.

Borland aims to change all that!

This month, Borland is making a tour of user groups in the Northwest.  They will be talking about Kylix in depth, their code name for the Delphi and C++Builder developer tools for Linux.  Come join us to see demos, ask questions, and get a head start on preparing for cross-platform development!

For more information on Kylix (and simply for some good reading!) see Homer Jones' article in this month's Computer Bits magazine, entitled Cross-Platform Development."  Also, be sure and visit <a href="http://www.borland.com/kylix/" target="_blank">Borland's web site on Kylix</a>!

PRESENTER:

Sr. Manager of Developer Relations, has been with Borland for 5 years. He is one of the main Delphi gurus at Borland and is the man behind CodeCentral on the Borland web site. He will present the main topic.
