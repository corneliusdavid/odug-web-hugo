## TOPIC ##

This is Part II to August's topic in a way because we will be looking at a different way to get your legacy applications to run through a browser. However, this time we'll be looking at a different product from the same company that provided Thinfinity VirtualUI. There are cases where that scenario doesn't quite cut it. Cybele Software provides another solution, [Thinfinity Remote Desktop Server](https://www.cybelesoft.com/thinfinity/remote-desktop/server).

There are many Remote Desktop clients and other ways to access remote desktops through a browser.  We will briefly explore options, then dive into the configuration details of Cybele Software's offering.
