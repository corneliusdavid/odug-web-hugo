Given the fact that I don't have time to put together another presentation and that people are probably  tired of listening to me anyway, I'm just going to host a general question-and-answer period, a networking  session if you will.  We can combine that with attempts stump-the-programmer where anyone can give or  take a challenge, man the keyboard and test their Delphi skills. 
 
I'll bring my laptop with Delpi 6 Professional, Firebird, DBISAM, Access, and several third-party  components including the TurboPower libraries, Rave Reports, Raize Controls 3, InfoPower 3000, Indy,  CodeSite, WPTools, and some custom components I've developed. 
 
We can talk about databases, object-oriented programming, security, the market, the weather, or  whatever else may come up.  Who knows, it could be one of the more interesting meetings! 
 
Hope to see you there.
