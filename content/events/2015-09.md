Many Delphi developers have not upgraded in quite some time. Some say Delphi 7 was the last great IDE, others got up to Delphi 2007 but never jumped into Unicode. There were some great language enhancements in Delphi 2010, but then the XE line started and the update rate increased dramatically adding 64-bit, FireMonkey, FireDAC, add-on tools, cross-platform capabilities, REST and JSON support, and many other things.

For some, the updates were considered little more than paid bug fixes. For others, the updates piled up on the virtual shelf with little time to figure out new features before the next version was out. But many of you just closed your wallet and stayed with what you had, comfortable in a fairly stable environment and getting third-party components to add support that only appeared in much newer versions of Delphi.

With [Delphi 10 Seattle](http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/44563) just released, this might be a good time to look back at the whole XE line of upgrades and review the changes that have taken place. There have been _NINE versions of Delphi in the last five years_, which is a nightmare if you're a component developer and a challenge to keep on top of if you're busy running a business. For developers that do upgrade, I suspect they either skip several versions at a time or just stick with one that is fairly stable for what they need to do and let the others pile up.

Tonight, we'll look through the following lists of "What's New" and pull up the IDEs to take a look at the highlights of the new and enhanced features you may have missed.  This will be an open discussion as it's unlikely any one person could be familiar with every single new feature!  (Case in point: The speaker has had very little time with FireMonkey and has no experience with FireDAC, so any attendees with knowledge in these areas are welcome to share their experience with the group.)

From the "docwiki.embarcadero.com" web site, here is the "What's New" list for each version we'll cover:
