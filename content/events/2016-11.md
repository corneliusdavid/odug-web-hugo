<h3>TOPICS</h3>

<p>
This month, we have a couple of topics to cover. The first presentation will cover manipulating meta files, including reading them from a database, displaying them properly on various sized screens, and preparing them for printing. The really cool thing is a metafile permits consistent quality report printing regardless of monitor resolution, aspect ratio, or user selected enlargement (125%, 150%, etc.). They can be used with any report writer that supports a TImage equivalent.  Homer Jones will share his experiences with us.
</p>

<a href="https://www.steema.com/"><img src="/sites/default/files/SteemaSoftware.png" align="right"></a>Our second presentation will be a demo of the TeeChart components by Steema Software.  You will see how to add charting to your application and see some demos that come with the product.  David Cornelius will be talking about this component set.
