<h3>TOPIC</h3>
<p>
This month, we'll continue exploring the client/server application we looked at last month, but we'll concentrate on the client end. The end result is an Android app that communicates by sending JSON data via REST protocols to the Windows server. We'll use Delphi 10.2 Tokyo and the Firemonkey framework utilizing both a Windows client for quick testing and then deploying to an Android phone.  The app will demonstrate login/logout, multiple pages with navigation, using a barcode scanner, and capturing a signature.
