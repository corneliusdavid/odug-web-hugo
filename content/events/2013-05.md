<h3>TOPIC</h3>
<p>
"<a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments."
</p>

<p>
Sounds like fun? There are several of us Delphi developers that are interested in this technology and one of our members has offered to share his passion for electronics, give us a hands-on demo, help us get started playing with this technology, and teach us a little of what you can do with it.

You can read more about it at <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/arduino/">MAKE Magazine</a> or on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino">Wikipedia</a>.

<h3>PRESENTER</h3>

<strong>Doug Ausmus</strong> started playing with electronics when he was 4 using an "Electric Build-it Set" which he earned by selling, with his brother, 12 boxes of "All Occasion" greeting cards door to door from an ad in a comic book. Programming with assembly language started in the mini computer days on a DEC PDP 11 and with microcomputers in the Intel 4004 days and later other vendors and chips as they came on the scene. He has never been without electronics and programming since and made it his business as well as one of his hobbies.
