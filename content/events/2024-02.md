Homer will discuss two topics: 1) how he created a [Chromium browser](https://www.chromium.org/Home/) in Delphi 2007, and 2) how he implemented drag 'n' drop between a VCL app and web page fields. Because Chromium relies on external DLLs, the steps involved in creating a browser in D2007 should apply to later Delphi versions.

The Chromium support files and libraries must reside in very specific relative paths. That becomes a consideration when distributing the application via an install program. We can touch on distribution if there is interest and time permits. The installation app was created using [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).

Drag and drop was done using Ray Konopka's excellent [DropMaster](https://raize.com/dropmaster/) controls. We will cover a couple of things that, if overlooked, can come back to bite. Demonstration will be done using Homer's actual commercial applications.

## PRESENTER ##

HOMER JONES is currently the President of [Agency Business Systems, Incorporated](https://agencybusys.com), a Portland-based company providing business management software to the Insurance Industry. He has been programming with Delphi since Delphi 1, and other languages before that going back to key-punched Hollerith cards, commonly called IBM cards by people who mistakenly thought IBM invented them. Old-timers know the heartbreak of spilling a deck of unsequenced cards.
