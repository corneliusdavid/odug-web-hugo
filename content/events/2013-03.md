<h3>TOPIC</h3>

<p>
On February 5, Embarcadero <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/press-releases/embarcadero-technologies-acquires-high-performance-enterprise-database-connectivity-technology-for-developers">announced</a> the purchase of a popular third party data access component library named AnyDAC. They have rebranded the library FireDAC for consistency with their new FireMonkey brand, although FireDAC doesn’t rely on FireMonkey in any way. FireDAC ships with the Enterprise, Ultimate and Architect SKUs and may be purchased by Pro users as a component pack. In the end, this appears to be a replacement of the dbExpress stack that Embarcadero has previously developed internally. As a result it’s a very significant change in direction for the company.
