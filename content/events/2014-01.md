TOPIC

Two of our regular attendees have upgraded to Embarcadero's latest version of Delphi and in fact, the whole RAD Studio suite. This month, we'll crack open the packages and take a look with them.

Doug Ausmus will show us his version of a "Hello World" which involves calling an external DLL to talk through a USB port to electronic circuit boards and watching LEDs blink.

Gene Juhos will show us what all we get when we start a new Android app from one of the several built-in mobile app templates.
