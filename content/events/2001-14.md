What does an NT Service, a Socket, ADO, and XML have to do with each other?  All four technologies are well supported by Delphi and all being utilized as part of one IVR application at Interactive Northwest.  David just completed his first Windows NT Service application--and learned a LOT! He would like to share his experience with the group to help make others aware of issues lurking in the shadows of this type of beast.
