This month we'll take a small console program written in Go, show and compare its equivalent as a Delphi console program, then write a simple Firemonkey application in Delphi based on the functionality. The concepts presented will include a brief overview of the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) web-building framework, the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) files it utilizes, the [TOML](https://toml.io/en) file format, how using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) can launch the web-building process on a local Linux computer, and finally an introduction to [Firemonkey](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio/fm-application-platform) resulting in a simple desktop app that can run on Mac or Windows to update a personal website.

Strap in for a wild ride!
