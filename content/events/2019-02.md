<h3>TOPIC</h3>
<p>
We're going to start off 2019 with a series of meetings that show you how to build a mobile application that talks to a server back-end. David will show a project built with Delphi 10.2 Tokyo that has two parts: 1) a Windows server console application that talks to an InterBase database and provides an API to which a client application connects; and 2) an Android app that connects to the server and communicates JSON data via REST protocols.
</p>

<p>
This first meeting will introduce the project and go over the database and server application.  We will look at a powerful, open source framework for building web apps, called <a href="https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework">DMVC Framework</a>. We'll show how to establish REST protocols, serialize JSON data, and test and debug your API.
