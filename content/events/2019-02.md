We're going to start off 2019 with a series of meetings that show you how to build a mobile application that talks to a server back-end. David will show a project built with Delphi 10.2 Tokyo that has two parts: 1) a Windows server console application that talks to an InterBase database and provides an API to which a client application connects; and 2) an Android app that connects to the server and communicates JSON data via REST protocols.

This first meeting will introduce the project and go over the database and server application.  We will look at a powerful, open source framework for building web apps, called [DMVC Framework](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework). We'll show how to establish REST protocols, serialize JSON data, and test and debug your API.
