## TOPIC ##

Borland will be presenting [Delphi 8](http://www.borland.com/delphi_net) in locations throughout the US.  We'll show you all the reasons why you should make Delphi 8 part of your .NET plans.

Here's a very brief taste of what we'll be looking at:

- ECO (Enterprise Core Objects)
- WinForms
- WebForms (ASP.NET)
- BDP for .NET (Borland Data Providers)
- VCL for .NET
- IDE features
- Compiler/language feature

There will be a special discounted offer at these meetings. You do not want to miss out on the substantial savings! The discount is 25% off on Delphi 8 Architect and Enterprise and 15% off on Delphi 8 Professional. Both new and upgrade pricing. More details at the meetings.

*Raffle! We will also raffle off at least one copy of Delphi 8 Enterprise at each meeting.*
